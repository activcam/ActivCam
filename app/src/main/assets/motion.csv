System Processing;daemon;Boolean;off;;;When Motion is started, immediately go to daemon mode and release the terminal. 
System Processing;process_id_file;String;;;;Specify the full path and file name in order to store the pid for processing. 
System Processing;setup_mode;Boolean;off;;;In setup mode two things happen: It outputs a lot of useful information for each frame from the camera. When you look at the webcam stream you see a black image with numbers. What you see is the number of changed pixels, number of labeled areas and noise setting. When something moves you see the pixels detected as Motion in black and white. The largest labeled area (assuming despeckle is enabled and with the 'l' at the end) is blue. It is only the blue areas which is counted as Motion. If smartmask is enabled you see this as red areas.
System Processing;logfile ;String;;;;Use this option to specify the full path and filename to use for logging of the messages generated from Motion. If this option is not defined, the stderr and syslog is used. Note that Motion can generate a LOT of messages and as a result, this option should be considered if the log_level is at any of the higher levels.
System Processing;log_level ;Integer;6;1;6;This option specifies the level of verbosity of the messages sent from Motion. At a level of 8(DBG), there are a LOT of messages. At a level of 1(EMR) virtually no messages will be output.
System Processing;log_type;String;all;COR,STR,ENC,NET,DBL,EVT,TRK,VID,ALL;;The different components of Motion use different log types. This option allows the user to only show the messages from particular components.
System Processing;camera;String;;;;The full path and file name for the camera file. Motion allows for this line to be listed in the motion.conf file multiple times. These specifications should be the LAST lines in the motion.conf file. 
System Processing;camera_id ;Integer;;;;This option is useful for situations where there are multiple cameras being used by Motion. This option allows for the assignment of a numeric id number that can be used in database queries as well as format specifiers. 
System Processing;camera_name;String;;;;This option specifies a camera name to be used in the format specifiers as well as on the web interface. 
System Processing;camera_dir ;String;;;;This option specifies a directory to contain the individual camera configuration files. Any files ending in '.conf' in this directory will be read as a camera config file. Users can disable a camera (config file) by renaming it so it does not end with '.conf'.
Video4Linux Device;videodevice;String;/dev/video0;;;The video device to be used for capturing. Default is /dev/video0. See the Basic Setup section of this guide for an additional discussion of this option. 
Video4Linux Device;v4l2_palette;String;17;0;21;The v4l2_palette allows the user to choose a palette to be use by Motion. This is only the preferred option. If the video device does not support this preferred format, Motion will loop through the available palettes to try to find one that is supported by both Motion and the device. Motion will report the supported palettes of the device when Motion starts when the log_level is specified as NTC or higher. 
Video4Linux Device;tunerdevice;Integer;1;-1;7;Input channel to use expressed as an integer number starting from 0. This option should normally be set to 1 for video/TV cards, and -1 for USB cameras. This parameter is used only with video capture cards that have more than one input. If you set the input number to values other than -1 USB cameras Motion will report an error message back. For video capture cards with tuners or multiple inputs such as S-VHS or Composite you may need to use this option to specify the correct input for the camera.
Video4Linux Device;norm;Integer;0;0;3;Select the video norm of the device. Values: 0 (PAL), 1 (NTSC), 2 (SECAM), 3 (PAL NC no colour). Default: 0 (PAL) This value is only used for capture cards using the BTTV driver. 
Video4Linux Device;frequency;Integer;-1;-1;3;This option allows the user to specify the power line frequency that is applicable to the user. This option can help stabilize the images of some webcams that are sensitive to this frequency. This is not normally necessary. 
Video4Linux Device;auto_brightness;Boolean;off;;; You need to know if the camera supports auto brightness. Most cameras have auto everything. If your video device already does this for you this option might cause oscillations. If you do not know assume that it has and do not use the Motion auto brightness feature. At least not to start with. 
Video4Linux Device;brightness;Integer;0;0;255;The brightness level for the video device. Value 0 means that Motion does not set the brightness value but leaves it unchanged. If this setting is used in conjunction with the auto_brightness feature then this setting is the average brightness level in the range 1 (dark) to 255 (bright) that the auto_brightness feature will try to achieve by adjusting the device brightness up and down. 
Video4Linux Device;contrast;Integer;0;0;255;The contrast level for the video device. Disabled (Value 0) means that Motion does not set the contrast value. 
Video4Linux Device;saturation;Integer;0;0;255;The color saturation level for the video device. 
Video4Linux Device;hue;Integer;0;0;255;The hue level for the video device. 
Video4Linux Device;roundrobin_frames;Integer;1;1;2147483647;Round Robin is not relevant for Network cameras or standard USB web cameras. It is used with video capture cards which have multiple inputs per video chip. This is not the ideal way to run multiple cameras. 
Video4Linux Device;roundrobin_skip ;Integer;1;1;2147483647;Specifies the number of frames to skip after a switch. (1 if you are feeling lucky, 2 if you want to be safe). The Round Robin feature is automatically activated where multiple cameras are sharing the same video device.
Video4Linux Device;switchfilter;Boolean;off;;;Turns the switch filter on or off. The filter can distinguish between most switching noise and real motion. With this you can even set roundrobin_skip to 1 without generating much false detection. This is a round robin related feature used when you have a capture card with multiple inputs (controlled by the 'input' option) on the same videodevice. 
Network Cameras;netcam_url;String;;;;URL to use if you are using a network camera, size will be autodetected. Available prefixes to the URL: http://, ftp://, mjpg://, rtsp://, rtmp://, mjpeg://, file://, v4l2://
Network Cameras;netcam_highres;String;;;;The network camera high resolution URL. This option can be used in conjunction with the netcam_url for rtsp/rtmp cameras. Users may specify the normal resolution url in the netcam_url which will be used for the motion detection and then specify the high resolution url for this parameter. Motion detection on the normal resolution will trigger the saving of images from the high resolution stream. 
Network Cameras;netcam_userpass;String;;;;The Username and password for the network camera. For http protocols, this option is for HTTP 1.1 Basic authentication only. The string is specified as username:password. To use no authentication simply remove this option. Digest authentication is only available for rtsp/rtmp cameras.
Network Cameras;netcam_keepalive;String;;off,force,on;;The setting for keep-alive of network socket, should improve performance on compatible net cameras (force: Use HTTP/1.0 requests, on: Use HTTP/1.1 requests ). Motion will ignore this option for rtsp/rtmp cameras.
Network Cameras;netcam_proxy;String;;;;"URL to use for a netcam proxy server, if required. The syntax is http://myproxy:portnumber Use this if you need to connect to a network camera through a proxy server. Example of syntax: ""http://myproxy.mydomain.com:1024 If the proxy port number is 80 you can omit the port number. Then the syntax is use ""http://myproxy.mydomain.com"" . "
Network Cameras;netcam_tolerant_check;String;;;;Use less strict jpeg checks for network cameras. Motion will ignore this option for rtsp/rtmp cameras. 
Network Cameras;rtsp_uses_tcp;Boolean;on;;;This option specifies the transport method for rtsp/rtmp cameras. The TCP transport is highly preferred because without this option the rtsp/rtmp images are frequently corrupted and result in many false positive values and images that appear to be smeared. Off indicates that UDP will be used. 
Raspberry Pi Camera;mmalcam_name;String;;;;"Name of camera to use if you are using a camera accessed through OpenMax/MMAL. The standard Raspberry Pi camera device name is ""vc.ril.camera"" without the quotes. Motion will ignore this option when the MMAL support is not included. In these situations, users will need to use the modprobe method of setting up the camera as a v4l2 device."
Raspberry Pi Camera;mmalcam_control_params;String;;;;This option allows the user to specify control parameters to the Pi camera. The documentation of all of the options available to the Raspberry Camera module is beyond the scope of this guide. Motion will ignore this option when the MMAL support is not included. In these situations, users will need to use the modprobe method of setting up the camera as a v4l2 device. 
Image Processing;rotate;String;0;0,90,180,270;;Rotate image the given number of degrees. The rotation affects all saved images as well as movies. The rotation feature is used when the camera is hanging upside down (180 degrees) or if you choose a picture format in portrait instead of the normal landscape (90 or 270 degrees). Note that the CPU load increases when using this feature with a value other than 0. Also note that Motion automatically swaps width and height if you rotate 90 or 270 degrees, so you don't have to touch these options.
Image Processing;flip_axis;String;none;none,v,h;;Flip the image according to specified axis. The flip affects all saved images as well as movies. The flip feature is used when the camera is pointed towards a mirror or provides itself a mirrored image (as found in some cars). Note that the CPU load increases when using this feature with a value other than none.
Image Processing;width;Integer;352;;;The width in pixels of each frame. Valid range is camera dependent. For all devices, the width must be a multiple of 8. Motion does not scale v4l2 devices and http netcams so the value should be set to the actual size of the image provided by the device. In case of a rtsp/rtmp network camera, Motion will rescale the camera image to the requested dimensions. 
Image Processing;height;Integer;288;;;The height in pixels of each frame. Valid range is camera dependent. For all devices, the height must be a multiple of 8. Motion does not scale v4l2 devices and http netcams so the value should be set to the actual size of the image provided by the device. In case of a rtsp/rtmp network camera, Motion will rescale the camera image to the requested dimensions. 
Image Processing;framerate;Integer;100;2;100;Maximum number of frames to be captured from the camera per second. The faster you fetch pictures from the camera the more CPU load you get and the more pictures get included when Motion is detected. Motion will stop storing pictures if the framerate is set to less than 2. Set this parameter to the maximum number of images per second that you want to store either as images or movies. To set intervals longer than one second use the 'minimum_gap' option instead.
Image Processing;minimum_frame_time;Integer;0;0;2147483647;Minimum time in seconds between the capturing picture frames from the camera. Default: 0 = disabled - the capture rate is given by the camera framerate. This option is used when you want to capture images at a rate lower than 2 per second. When this is enabled the framerate option is used only to set the pace the Motion service the webcam port etc. 
Image Processing;despeckle_filter;String;;;;Despeckle motion image using combinations of (E/e)rode or (D/d)ilate. And ending with optional (l)abeling. A way of tuning (by removing or enhancing) noise in the motion image. Options for the despeckle feature are any of 'e', 'E', 'd' or 'D'. This can be combined by a trailing 'l' (letter l) which enables the labeling feature. 
Image Processing;locate_motion_mode;String;off;on,off,preview;;Locate and draw a box around the moving object. Value 'preview' makes Motion only draw a box on a saved preview jpeg image and not on the saved movie. 
Image Processing;locate_motion_style;String;;box,redbox,cross,redcross;;Set the look and style of the locate box if enabled. 
Image Processing;text_left;String;;;;User defined text overlaid on each in the lower left corner (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS). If the option is not defined no text is displayed at this position. By combining spaces and new lines '\n' you can place your text anywhere on the picture. When setting the text using http remote control the text must be URL encoded. 
Image Processing;text_right;String;%Y-%m-%d\n%T;;;User defined text overlaid on each in the lower right corner (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS). If the option is not defined no text is displayed at this position. By combining spaces and new lines '\n' you can place your text anywhere on the picture. When setting the text using http remote control the text must be URL encoded. 
Image Processing;text_changes;Boolean;off;;;Turns the text showing changed pixels on/off. By setting this option to 'on' the number of pixels that changed compared to the reference frame is displayed in the upper right corner of the pictures. This is good for calibration and testing. This is how the overlaid text is located. 
Image Processing;text_event;String;%Y%m%d%H%M%S;;;This option is special in that it defines the conversion specifier %C which can be used both for text display and for filenames. This option defines the value of the special event conversion specifier %C. You can use any conversion specifier in this option except %C. Date and time values are from the timestamp of the first image in the current event. The idea is that %C can be used filenames and text_left/right for creating a unique identifier for each event. Option text_event defines the value %C which then can be used in filenames and text_right/text_left. The text_event/%C uses the time stamp for the first image detected in a new event. %C is an empty string when no event is in progress (gap period expired). Pre_captured and minimum_motion_frames images are time stamped before the event happens so %C in text_left/right does not have any effect on those images. 
Image Processing;text_double;Boolean;off;;;Draw characters at twice normal size on images. This option makes the text defined by text_left, text_right and text_changes twice the normal size. This may be useful when using large picture formats such as 1280 x 720. 
Motion Detection;emulate_motion;Boolean;off;;;Always save images even if there was no motion.
Motion Detection;threshold;Integer;1500;1;2147483647;Threshold for declaring motion. The threshold is the number of changed pixels counted after noise filtering, masking, despeckle, and labelling. The 'threshold' option is the most important detection setting. When motion runs it compares the current image frame with the previous and counts the number of changed pixels after having processed the image with noise filtering, masking, despeckle and labeling. If more pixels than defined by 'threshold' have changed we assume that we have detected motion. Set the threshold as low as possible so that you get the motion you want detected but large enough so that you do not get detections from noise and plants moving. Note that the larger your frames are, the more pixels you have. So for large picture frame sizes you need a higher threshold. Use the -s (setup mode) command line option and/or the text_changes config file option to experiment to find the right threshold value. If you do not get small movements detected (see the mouse on the kitchen floor) lower the value. If motion detects too many birds or moving trees, increase the number. (Unless of course you are one of the many many users who use Motion to bird watch!) Practical values would be from a few hundred to thousands. 
Motion Detection;threshold_tune;Boolean;off;;;Activate the automatic tuning of threshold level. This feature makes Motion continuously adjust the threshold for declaring motion. The threshold setting is ignored when activating this feature. It may give different results depending on your camera, light conditions, indoor/outdoor, the motion to be detected etc. If it does not work well, deactivate the 'threshold_tune' option and use the manual setting of threshold instead.
Motion Detection;noise_level;Integer;32;1;255;The noise level is used as a threshold for distinguishing between noise and motion. This is different from the threshold parameter. This is changes at pixel level. The purpose is to eliminate the changes generated by electric noise in the camera. Especially in complete darkness you can see the noise as small grey dots that come randomly in the picture. This noise can create false motion detection. What this parameter means is that the intensity of a pixel must change more than +/- the noise threshold parameter to be counted. 
Motion Detection;noise_tune;Boolean;on;;;Activates the automatic tuning of noise level. This feature makes Motion continuously adjust the noise threshold for distinguishing between noise and motion. The 'noise_level' setting is ignored when activating this feature. It may give different results depending on camera and light conditions. 
Motion Detection;area_detect;String;;;;"Detect motion in predefined areas (1 - 9) and when Motion is detected in the area, execute the script. All of motion detection still continue. This option is only to execute the on_area_detect script. Areas are numbered like: ""1 2 3""."
Motion Detection;mask_file;String;;;;The full path and filename for the masking pgm file. If needed, the mask will be resized to match the width and height of the frames being captured. If you have one or more areas of the camera image in which you do NOT want motion detected (e.g. a tree that moves in the wind or a corner of the picture where you can see cars/pedestrians passing by) you need a mask file.
Motion Detection;mask_privacy;String;;;;The full path and filename for the privacy masking pgm file. This file works like the mask_file as described above. The difference with this parameter is that while the mask_file excludes the section from detecting motion, this file excludes the section of the image completely. 
Motion Detection;smart_mask_speed;Integer;0;0;10;Speed for the smart mask. Default is 0 = DISABLED. 1 is slow, 10 is fast. Smartmask is a dynamic, self-learning mask. Smartmask will disable sensitivity in areas with frequent motion (like trees in the wind).
Motion Detection;lightswitch;Integer;0;0;100;Ignore sudden massive light intensity changes given as a percentage of the picture area that changed intensity. The value defines the picture areas in percent that will trigger the lightswitch condition. When lightswitch is detected motion detection is disabled for 5 picture frames. This is to avoid false detection when light conditions change and when a camera changes sensitivity at low light. 
Motion Detection;minimum_motion_frames;Integer;1;0;1000;Picture frames must contain motion at least the specified number of frames in a row before they are detected as true motion. At the default of 1, all motion is detected. Valid range is 1 to thousands, but it is recommended to keep it within 1-5. Note that the picture frames are buffered by Motion and once motion is detected also the first frames containing motion are saved so you will not miss anything. The feature is used when you get many false detections when the camera changes light sensitivity or light changes. Even though Motion accepts large values you should set this to a relatively low number (below 10).
Motion Detection;event_gap;Integer;60;0;2147483647;The seconds of no motion detection that triggers the end of an event. An event is defined as a series of motion images taken within a short timeframe. The value -1 is allowed and disables events causing all Motion to be written to one single movie file and no pre_capture. If set to 0, motion is running in gapless mode. An event ends right after no more motion is detected and post_capture is over. 
Script Execution;on_event_start ;String;;;;The full path and file name of the program/script to be executed at the start of an event. An event starts at first motion detected after a period of no motion defined by gap. 
Script Execution;on_event_end;String;;;;The full path and file name of the program/script to be executed when a event ends. An event ends after the event_gap has expired. 
Script Execution;on_picture_save;String;;;;The full path and file name of the program/script to be executed when a picture is saved. Use %f for passing filename (with full path) to the command. 
Script Execution;on_motion_detected;String;;;;The full path and file name of the program/script to be executed when motion is detected. 
Script Execution;on_area_detected;String;;;;The full path and file name of the program/script to be executed when motion is detected in the predefined area indicated in the area_detect option. Use %f for passing filename (with full path) to the command. 
Script Execution;on_movie_start;String;;;;The full path and file name of the program/script to be executed when a new movie is being created.
Script Execution;on_movie_end;String;;;;The full path and file name of the program/script to be executed after a new movie was created. Use %f for passing filename (with full path) to the command.
Script Execution;on_camera_lost;String;;;;"The full path and file name of the command to be executed when a camera can't be opened or if it is lost.
Note that there are situations when motion doesn't detect a lost camera. It is dependent upon the camera and driver and it is advised that this option be tested for each configuration. It has also been observed that there are also situations in which the disconnection of the camera even hangs the PC in which case this script will not be executed."
Script Execution;on_camera_found;String;;;;The full path and file name of the command to be executed when a lost camera is found If motion fails to detect a lost camera, it will also fail to know it found one.
Output - General Options;quiet;Boolean;off;;;Be quiet, don't output beeps when detecting motion. Only works in non-daemon mode.
Output - General Options;pre_capture;Integer;0;0;100;Specifies the number of pre-captured (buffered) pictures from before motion was detected that will be output at motion detection. The recommended range is 0 to 5. It is not recommended to use large values. Large values will cause Motion to skip video frames and cause unsmooth movies.
Output - General Options;post_capture;Integer;0;0;2147483647;Specifies the number of frames to be captured after motion has been detected. The purpose of this is mainly to create smooth video clips each time motion is detected. Use it to you personal taste (and disk space).
Output - General Options;target_dir;String;;;;The full path for the target directory for picture and movie files to be saved. The default is the current working directory. This is the target directory for all snapshots, images files and movie files. You will normally always want to specify this parameter as an absolute path. Not defined = current working directory
Output - Picture Options;output_pictures;String;on;on,off,first,best;;"on' is the usual selection. 'first' is Motion saves only the first motion detected picture per event. 'best' requires a little more CPU power and resources compared to ""first"". If you set it to ""best"" Motion saves the picture with most changed pixels during the event. This may be useful if you store movies on a server and want to present a jpeg to show the content of the movie on a webpage. 'off' to don't write pictures."
Output - Picture Options;output_debug_pictures;Boolean;off;;;Output pictures with only the moving object. This feature generates the special motion type movies where you only see the pixels that changes as a graytone image. If labelling is enabled you see the largest area in blue. If a Smartmask is specified, it is shown in red. This option is good for tuning and testing but probably not very interesting for the general public.
Output - Picture Options;quality;Integer;75;0;100;The quality for the jpeg or webp images in percent. 100 means hardly compressed. A small number means a much smaller file size but also a poorer quality image to look at.
Output - Picture Options;picture_type;String;;;;This option specifies the type of picture file to output. The recommendation is to always use jpg except if you have a specific need to store high quality pictures without any quality loss.
Output - Picture Options;snapshot_interval;Integer;0;0;2147483647;This parameter specifies the number of seconds between each snapshot 
Output - Picture Options;snapshot_filename;String;%v-%Y%m%d%H%M%S-snapshot;;;This option indicates the file name and optionally the path for the snapshots (jpeg or ppm) relative to target_dir. The file extension .jpg or .ppm is automatically added. A symbolic link called lastsnap.jpg (or lastsnap.ppm) is created in the target_dir and will always point to the latest snapshot, unless snapshot_filename is exactly 'lastsnap'
Output - Picture Options;picture_filename;String;%v-%Y%m%d%H%M%S-%q;;;This option indicates the file name and optionally the path for the pictures (jpeg or ppm) relative to target_dir. The file extension .jpg or .ppm is automatically added. 
Output - Picture Options;exif_text;String;;;;Use this option to specify the text to include in a JPEG EXIF comment The EXIF timestamp is included independent of this text.
Output - Movie Options;max_movie_time;Integer;3600;0;2147483647;The maximum length of a movie in seconds. Set this to zero for unlimited length.
Output - Movie Options;ffmpeg_output_movies;Boolean;off;;;Use ffmpeg libraries to encode movies of the motion. This option generates a new movie at the beginning of each new event and appends to the movie for each motion detected within the same event. The current event ends when the time defined by the 'event_gap' option has passed with no motion detected. At the next detection of motion a new movie is started. 
Output - Movie Options;ffmpeg_output_debug_movies;Boolean;off;;;Use ffmpeg libraries to encode motion type movies where you only see the pixels that changes. Works like ffmpeg_output_movies but outputs motion pixel type pictures instead. This feature generates the special motion type movie where you only see the pixels that changes as a graytone image. If labeling is enabled you see the largest area in blue. Smartmask is shown in red. The filename given is the same as the normal movies except they have an 'm' appended after the filename.
Output - Movie Options;ffmpeg_bps;Integer;400000;0;9999999;Bitrate of movies produced by ffmpeg. Bitrate is bits per second. A higher value means better quality and larger files if the camera is on a fixed bitrate setting. Experiment to get the desired quality. The better quality the bigger files. This option is ignored if ffmpeg_variable_bitrate is not 0 (disabled).
Output - Movie Options;ffmpeg_variable_bitrate;Integer;0;0;100;Enables and defines a variable bitrate for the ffmpeg encoder. The option of ffmpeg_bps is ignored if variable bitrate is enabled. A value of 0 disables this option while values 1 - 100 varies the quality of the movie. The value of 1 means worst quality and 100 is the best quality. Experiment for the value that gives you the desired compromise between size and quality.
Output - Movie Options;ffmpeg_video_codec;String;mpeg4;mpeg4,msmpeg4,swf,flv,ffv1,mov,ogg,mp4,mkv,hevc;;Note that certain containers can handle different codecs than the defaults indicated above. For example, the mkv container can handle virtually any codec. Motion can optionally take an additional specification with this parameter. By specifying the container (mkv) and then appending a semicolon and the ffmpeg codec name Motion will attempt to use the specified codec for the container. This permits options such as encoding the h265 codec into a mkv container instead of mp4 by specifying the option as mkv:h265
Output - Movie Options;ffmpeg_duplicate_frames;Boolean;off;;;"When specified, if the CPU can not keep up with the requested frame rate for the movies, frames will be duplicated in order to keep up with the frame rate. Use this option with care since the resulting movies will have the same frame sent multiple times and therefore the movie may appear to ""stall"" and look terrible."
Output - Movie Options;movie_filename;String;%v-%Y%m%d%H%M%S;;;File path for motion triggered movies relative to target_dir. Note that the file extension is automatically added to the name based upon the codec selected.
Output - Movie Options;timelapse_filename;String;%v-%Y%m%d-timelapse;;;File path for the timelapse videos relative to target_dir. Note that the file extension is automatically added to the name based upon the codec selected.
Output - Movie Options;timelapse_interval;Integer;0;0;2147483647;Create a timelapse video saving a picture frame at the interval in seconds set by this parameter. 
Output - Movie Options;timelapse_mode;String;daily;hourly,daily,weekly-sunday,weekly-monday,monthly,manual;;The file rollover mode of the timelapse video. Note that it is important that you use the Conversion Specifiers in timelapse_filename that ensure that the new timelapse file indeed is a new file. If the filename does not change Motion will simply append the timelapse pictures to the existing file. The value 'Manual' means that Motion does not automatically rollover to a new filename. You can do it manually using the http control interface by setting the option timelapse_interval to 0 and then back to your chosen value.
Output - Movie Options;timelapse_codec;String;mpg;mpg,mpeg4;;"Container/Codec to be used by timelapse video. 'mpg' - Creates mpg file with mpeg-2 encoding. If Motion is shutdown and restarted, new pics will be appended to any previously created file with name indicated for timelapse. 'mpeg4' - Creates avi file with the default encoding. If Motion is shutdown and restarted, new pics will create a new file with the name indicated for timelapse.
"
Output - Movie Options;timelapse_fps;Integer;30;0;2147483647;The frame per second rate to use in the playback of the timelapse video.
Output - Pipe Options;video_pipe;String;;;;Default: not set The video4linux video loopback device for normal images. The device would be specified in the format like /dev/video1
Output - Pipe Options;motion_video_pipe;String;;;;The video4linux video loopback device for motion images. The device would be specified in the format like /dev/video1
Output - Pipe Options;use_extpipe;String;;;;"This option specifies whether to send the output to a pipe for external encoding into a movie. Piping raw video to stdout has some advantages comparing to using built-in ffmpeg encoder.
First, you can use any encoder that supports RAW frames from stdin so you are not limited to the formats that are currently implemented in motion. Second, external encoders utilize separate cpu core(s) on multi-core systems so movie encoding is offloaded from main motion thread to separate core(s) giving noticeable performance boost."
Output - Pipe Options;extpipe;String;;;;This option specifies the program name and options for the program that will receive and process the images during a movie event. 
Stream and Webcontrol;ipv6_enabled;Boolean;off;;;Listen to IPv6 localhost instead of IPv4 (default: off)
Stream and Webcontrol;stream_port;Integer;0;0;65535;The TCP port that Motion will send the main stream. Each camera must have its own unique port number and it must also be different from the webcontrol_port number. A good value to select is 8081 for camera 1, 8082 for camera 2, 8083 for camera 3 etc. This must be placed in the camera config file (unless you only have one camera, in which case it can be placed in motion.conf). 
Stream and Webcontrol;substream_port;Integer;0;0;65535;"TCP Port to use for providing a 50% scaled down ""substream"". The substream shares all the same settings as main stream and only scales the image down to reduce the required bandwidth. Each camera must have its own unique port number and it must also be different from the webcontrol_port number. This must be placed in the camera config file (unless you only have one camera, in which case it can be placed in motion.conf). "
Stream and Webcontrol;stream_quality;Integer;50;1;100;"Quality setting in percent for the mjpeg picture frames transferred over the webcam connection. Keep it low to restrict needed bandwidth.
The mjpeg stream consists of a header followed by jpeg frames separated by content-length and the boundary string.
The quality level defines the size of the individual jpeg pictures in the mjpeg stream. If you set it too high you need a lot of bandwidth to view the stream."
Stream and Webcontrol;stream_motion;Boolean;off;;;When set to 'on', slow down the stream to 1 picture per second when no motion is detected. When motion is detected the stream runs as defined by stream_maxrateWhen 'off' the stream always runs as defined by stream_maxrate. Use this option to save bandwidth when there is not anything important to see from the camera anyway.
Stream and Webcontrol;stream_maxrate;Integer;1;1;100;Limit the framerate of the stream in frames per second. Set the value to 100 for practically unlimited. Don't set this parameter too high unless you only use it on the localhost or on an internal LAN.
Stream and Webcontrol;stream_localhost;Boolean;on;;;Limits the access to the stream to the localhost. By setting this to on, the stream can only be accessed on the same machine on which Motion is running.
Stream and Webcontrol;stream_limit;Integer;0;0;2147483647;This parameter limits the maximum number of images per connection and is determined by multiplying actual stream rate by desired number of seconds (default: 0 = unlimited).
Stream and Webcontrol;stream_auth_method;Integer;0;0;2;This parameter establishes desired authentication method for the stream and web control ports. The parameters have the following meaning. 0 = disabled, 1 = Basic authentication, 2 = MD5 digest (the safer authentication)
Stream and Webcontrol;stream_authentication;String;;;;This parameter establishes the username and password to use for the stream. The syntax is username:password 
Stream and Webcontrol;stream_preview_scale;Integer;25;0;2147483647;If the webcontrol page has HTML enabled, Motion displays all of the streams on the home webcontrol page in HTML format so that all the images can be viewed by standard browsers.This parameter indicates the percentage to scale the stream image when it is placed on the page. Note that this is scaled on the browser side, Motion will keep sending full frame. Numbers greater than 100 are permitted.
Stream and Webcontrol;stream_preview_newline;Boolean;on;;;If the webcontrol page has HTML enabled, Motion displays all images of the streams on the home webcontrol page in HTML format so that all the images can be viewed by standard browsers. This parameter determines whether the image is placed on a new line in the webcontrol web page. 
Stream and Webcontrol;webcontrol_port;Integer;0;0;65535;Sets the port number for the http based control of the Motion parameters. This option must be placed in the motion.conf file and not in a camera config file. Port numbers below 1024 normally require that you have root privileges. The port 8080 is the typical selection of the port for this purpose. 
Stream and Webcontrol;webcontrol_localhost;Boolean;on;;;This option restricts the control of the Motion parameters to the localhost. This option must be placed in motion.conf and not in a camera config file. By setting this to on, the control using http (browser) can only be accessed on the same machine on which Motion is running.
Stream and Webcontrol;webcontrol_html_output;Boolean;on;;;"Enable HTML in the answer sent back to a browser connecting to the webcontrol_port. This option must be placed in motion.conf and not in a camera config file. The recommended value for most is ""on"" which means that you can navigate and control Motion with a normal browser. By setting this option to ""off"" the replies are in plain text which may be easier to parse for 3rd party programs that control Motion. "
Stream and Webcontrol;webcontrol_authentication;String;;;;This parameter establishes the username and password to use for the stream. The syntax is username:password 
Stream and Webcontrol;webcontrol_parms;Integer;0;0;3;"Sets the type of parameters that will be listed on the webcontrol page and available for modification. 0: None - No configuration parameters will be available. 1: Limited- A limited list of parameters will be available. 2: Advanced - The advanced list of parameters will be available. These typically require Motion to be restarted to become effective.
    3: Restricted - User IDs, passwords and ""On"" commands.

The default for this parameter is 0 none to enhance the security of the web interface. "
Database;sql_log_picture;Boolean;on;;;Log to the database when Motion triggers a image file to be saved.

Database;sql_query;String;;;;SQL query string that is sent to the database when the sql_log_* item is triggered.
Database;sql_query_start;String;;;;SQL query that executes against the event table which tracks the unique events of motion. 
Database;database_type;String;;mysql,postgresql,sqlite3;;This option specifies the database type.
Database;database_dbname;String;;;;The name of the database. For Sqlite3, the full path and name to the database.
Database;database_host;String;;;;The host on which the database is located.
Database;database_user;String;;;;The user account name for database.
Database;database_password;String;;;;The user password for database.
Database;database_port;Integer;0;0;65535;The port number that is used for the database. Typical values are: mysql=3306 and postgresql=5432 
Database;database_busy_timeout;Integer;0;0;2147483647;If the database is busy when the request is issued, this parameter indicates the time to wait in milliseconds before issuing a timeout message.
Tracking;track_type;Integer;0;0;5;Type of tracker. Motion has special tracking options which use either a serial stepper motor controller, an iomojo smile cam or a Philips WebCam driver compatible pan/tilt camera such as the Logitech Quickcam Sphere or Orbit. 1 (stepper), 2 (iomojo), 3 (pwc), 4 (generic), 5 (uvcvideo)
Tracking;track_auto;Boolean;off;;;Enable auto tracking Requires a tracking camera type supported by Motion.
